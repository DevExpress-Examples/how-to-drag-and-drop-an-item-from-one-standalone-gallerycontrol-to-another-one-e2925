# How to drag and drop an item from one standalone GalleryControl to another one


<p>This sample illustrates how to drag and drop a GalleryItem from one standalone GalleryControl to another one. The implemented approach is quite standard. It is required to get an item from one GalleryControl via the <strong>MouseDown</strong> and <strong>MouseMove</strong> event handlers, start the drag and drop operation via the <strong>DoDragAndDrop</strong> method from one GalleryControl and insert the item being dragged into the other GalleryControl by handling the <strong>DragDrop</strong> event.<br />
